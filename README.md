Now, they provide you with the dataset ( World Economic Indicator Dataset), which has different countries and regions' GDP, population, and other factors that might impact GDP/Capita. Now using Data Analysis methods, develop a solution that can be referred to as “how a country can attain sustainable growth“.

### APPLIED FORMATTING AND DATA PROCESSING

  1) Created new features: GDP/ capita , CO2 emssion / capita, Energy consumption / capita, Tourism outbound / Capita.

  2) Find the outlier value for the columns

  3) Find the outlier value for the columns

  4) Handles missing value using required formula (using IF function)

  5) Use of Vlookup formula to merge

  6) Created a unique key : country/region and year

### PERFORMED ANALYSIS TO GAIN INSIGHTS

  1) Performed Bivariate analysis between GDP / capita and other features

  2) Performed Univariate Analysis with statistical values and histogram graph

  3) Creeated pivot tables and charts.

### EVALUATED THE INSIGHTS AND CREATE A STORYLINE

  1) Prepared PPT with all the points
